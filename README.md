# PROCDL
Download files using processing and PROCDL api. JAVA MODE ONLY!!
## Why
Processing's HTTPClient api is not that great.
For me, it can't download a picture from NGINX server:(

```
400 Bad request
```
PROCDL can download any file from any server!

## this not a finished product, no!
This is a little tool for developers and no more.
If you are searching for a cool downloader that will work everywhere - Use CURL!
